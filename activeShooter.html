        <h1>Active Shooter</h1>
        <p>An active shooter is a person who appears to be actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area; in most cases active shooters use firearm(s) and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims. These situations are dynamic and evolve rapidly, demanding immediate deployment of law enforcement resources to stop the shooting and mitigate harm to innocent victims. This section provides guidance to persons who may be caught in an active shooter situation, and describes what to expect from responding police officers.</p> 
        <h4>What Should You Do:</h4> 
        <p>In general, how you respond to an active shooter will be directed by the specific circumstances of the encounter, bearing in mind there could be more than one shooter involved in the same situation. If you find yourself involved in an active shooter situation, try to remain calm and use these guidelines to help you plan a strategy for survival:</p> 
        <h5>WHEN AN ACTIVE SHOOTER IS IN YOUR VICINITY</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Run
                <ul>
                    <li>Have an escape route and plan in mind</li>
                    <li>Leave your belongings behind</li>
                    <li>Keep your hands visible</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Hide
                <ul>
                    <li>Hide in an area out of the shooterâ€™s view</li>
                    <li>Block entry to your hiding place and lock the doors</li>
                    <li>Silence your cell phone and/or pager</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fight
                <ul>
                    <li>As a last resort and only when your life is in imminent danger</li>
                    <li>Attempt to incapacitate the shooter</li>
                    <li>Act with physical aggression and throw items at the active shooter</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARRIVES</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Remain calm and follow instructions</li>
            <li>Put down any items in your hands (i.e., bags, jackets)</li>
            <li>Raise hands and spread fingers</li>
            <li>Keep hands visible at all times</li>
            <li>Avoid quick movements toward officers such as holding on to them for safety</li>
            <li>Avoid pointing, screaming or yelling</li>
            <li>Do not stop to ask officers for help or direction when evacuating</li>
        </ul> 
         <h5>INFO YOU SHOULD PROVIDE 911</h5>
         <ul>
             <li>Location of the active shooter</li>
             <li>Number of shooters</li>
             <li>Physical description of shooters</li>
             <li>Number and type of weapons held by shooters</li>
             <li>Number of potential victims at the location</li>
         </ul> 
        <h5>CALL 911 WHEN SAFE TO DO SO</h5><br> 
        <h4>What to Expect from Responding Officers:</h4>
        <p>Police Officers responding to an active shooter are trained to proceed immediately to the area in which shots were last heard. Their purpose is to stop the shooting as quickly as possible. The first responding officers may be dressed in regular patrol uniforms, or they may be wearing external bulletproof vests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment. The officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, or handguns, and might be using tasers, pepper spray, or tear gas to control the situation. Regardless of how they appear, remain calm, do as the officers tell you, and do not be afraid of them. Put down any bags or packages you may be carrying and keep your hands visible at all times. If you know where the shooter is, tell the officers. The first officers to arrive will not stop to aid injured people; rescue teams composed of other officers and emergency medical personnel will follow the first officers into secured areas to treat and remove injured persons. Keep in mind that even once you have escaped to a safer location, the entire area is still a crime scene; police will usually not let anyone leave until the situation is fully under control and all witnesses have been identified and questioned. Until you are released, remain at whatever assembly point authorities designate</p>
