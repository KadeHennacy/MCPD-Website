        <h1>Bomb Threat</h1>
        <p>Most bomb threats will be received as a phone call. But a bomb threat could be a handwritten note, an email or receipt of a suspicious package. If a bomb threat is a handwritten note, call the MCPD and handle the note as minimally as possible.</p>
        <p>If the bomb threat is an email, call the MCPD and do not delete the message. If the threat is in the form of a suspicious package, be aware of these signs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No return address</li>
            <li>Excessive postage</li>
            <li>Stains</li>
            <li>Strange odor</li>
            <li>Strange sounds</li>
            <li>Unexpected delivery</li>
            <li>Poor handwriting</li>
            <li>Misspelled words</li>
            <li>Incorrect titles</li>
            <li>Foreign postage</li>
            <li>Restrictive notes</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>DO NOT:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Use two-way radios or cell phone; radio signals have the potential to detonate a bomb</li>
            <li>Evacuate the building until police arrive and evaluate the threat</li>
            <li>Activate the fire alarm</li>
            <li>Touch or move a suspicious package</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upon receiving a bomb threat phone call, immediately complete the Bomb Threat Checklist (see addenda). The person receiving the call should alert someone within the office to immediately notify Marietta College Police or this person should call Marietta College Police immediately upon ending the phone call.</p>
        <h5>During the call:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Remain calm. Keep the caller on the line for as long as possible. DO NOT HANG UP, even if the caller does.</li>
            <li>Listen carefully, be polite, and show interest.</li>
            <li>Try to keep the caller talking to learn more information.</li>
            <li>If possible, write a note to a colleague to call the MCPD or, as soon as the caller hangs up, immediately notify them yourself.</li>
            <li>If you phone has a display, copy the number and/or letters of the caller ID.</li>
            <li>Complete the Bomb Threat Checklist (see addenda) immediately. Write down as much as you can remember. Try to get exact words.</li>
            <li>Immediately upon termination of the call, do not hang up, but from a different phone, contact MCPD immediately with information and wait for their instructions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Marietta College Police will make a determination as to whether the building, area, or campus should be evacuated.</p>
        <p>In the event an evacuation is ordered, the evacuation should be implemented in a manner, which provides the maximum amount of time for evacuation prior to the alleged detonation time of the device. Reentry should not occur until a thorough search of the premises has been conducted and a reasonable and safe amount of time has elapsed past the alleged detonation time. A reasonable and safe amount of time may vary by incident, and the decision to re-enter must be made based upon the best information available.</p>
        <p>Evacuation is to be conducted in an orderly manner, following the established fire evacuation routes, but avoiding any area identified as the possible location of the suspected device. Evacuated occupants should be assembled in the established fire evacuation assembly areas, but at least 400 – 600 feet away in order to protect individuals should an explosion occur. MCPD personnel and other College officials should not operate their portable two-way radios within 500 feet of the affected building, area, or location.</p>
        <p>Once the building has been evacuated, all exterior entrances will be secured or monitored to prevent unauthorized reentry.</p>
        <p>The Marietta College Police Chief, or his/her designee, will activate a college response team and proceed with the establishment of a command post and search procedures. Depending on the nature of the threat, the decision will be made by the College President or his/her designee as to the appropriate response after consulting with emergency personnel (Police and Fire).</p>
        <h5>Some options are:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Occupant team search: perform a low key “covert” search using campus personnel assisting the trained emergency responders. Doing a search with campus personnel has the advantage of the fact that they are familiar with which items should and should not be present. Suspicious items may be apparent to Marietta College personnel where they might not be to Police and Fire. Designated College officials shall be available to provide assistance as requested. Security personnel shall provide needed items to searchers such and pass keys. Keep in mind that two way radios could possibly set off an explosive device. If the caller indicates a detonation time, the search will be called off 30 minutes prior to that time and all personnel evacuated.</li>
            <li>Conduct an immediate evacuation by activating the Pioneer Alert emergency notification system.  Instruct evacuees to take all personal items with them when leaving the building. Be aware of the fact that if an actual explosive device is being used that that odds of a secondary device in the parking lot is great. Open areas would be safer than the cars in the parking lots. People should be directed to stay at least 400-600 feet from the building (beyond the parking lots).</li>
