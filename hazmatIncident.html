        <h4>EMERGENCY RESPONSE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RELEASES (AIRBORNE) OUTSIDE OF BUILDINGS:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A shelter-in-place or evacuation instructions Pioneer Alert will be made if possible. Releases are possible from train tank cars, tanker trucks, etc. (Washington County EMA plan indicates that initial alert to schools will be made by the police.)</li>
            <li>In response to shelter-in-place you should remain in the building, close all doors, and all windows. Locking the doors and windows will improve the seal to keep air out. Move to an interior windowless room if possible</li>
            <li>If available, add additional seal to doors and windows with trash bags and tape.</li>
            <li>Use wet towels or other wet cloth to push into the crack at the bottom of doors.</li>
            <li>Turn off fans, air conditioners, range hoods, fume hoods, and air handlers.</li>
            <li>Physical Plant will shut down most HVAC systems as appropriate.</li>
            <li>Do not use elevators if possible because they will tend to bring in outside air.</li>
            <li>If your breathing becomes bothered, you may cover your nose and mouth with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li>Breathing difficulties may be reported to college police at 740-376-3333 or 911. </li>
            <li>Be prepared to monitor Pioneer Alert and/or local media. Instructions may advise that you move upstairs or downstairs in a building depending on whether the released material is heavier or lighter than air.</li>
            <li>Continue to monitor Pioneer Alert and/or local media but do not evacuate unless advised to do so.</li>
            <li>If evacuation orders are issued, follow instructions and leave as quickly as possible. If reasonable to do so take your coat, keys, vital items such as important medications, etc. with you.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>RELEASES INSIDE OF BUILDINGS (Laboratories for example)</h4>
        <ul>

            <li>If toxic chemicals come in contact with your skin, immediately flush the affected area with clean water for 15 minutes. Use safety showers and/or eye wash stations, if available.</li>
            <li>Have someone call 911 IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            <li>If you are advised that there is a chemical or biological spill inside of a building assume that the material may be hazardous.</li>
            <li>Leave the building quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>If reasonably possible take your coat, keys, etc. with you.</li>
            <li>If you were conducting an experiment attempt to quickly stabilize or shut it down if possible.</li>
